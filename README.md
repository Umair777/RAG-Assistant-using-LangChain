A modular, production-aligned Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built with LangChain and deployed via Docker.


This Space demonstrates a production-aligned AI pipeline combining document ingestion, embeddings, vector retrieval, and contextual response generation.

---

## Overview

This application showcases:

- Document ingestion pipeline
- Embedding generation
- Vector database retrieval
- Context-aware response synthesis
- Docker-based deployment architecture

The system is designed to reflect real-world RAG architecture used in enterprise AI systems.
